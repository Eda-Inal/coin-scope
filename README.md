# Crypto Tracker Website

I have recently completed the development of my crypto tracker application using Next.js & TypeScript

- **Next.js & TypeScript**
- **State management with Redux Toolkit**
- **Firebase Authentication**
- **Storing favorite coins with Firestore**
- **Multi-language & theme support** (persisted with localStorage)
- **Fetching real-time data from CoinGecko API**
- **Price change graph with Recharts**


**Live Demo**: https://coin-scope-sandy.vercel.app/
